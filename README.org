I've added a new calendar section with Google Calendar integration. Here's what you'll need to do to make it fully functional:

Replace YOUR_CALENDAR_ID in two places:
In the iframe src attribute
In the "Add to Your Calendar" button onclick URL
To get your Calendar ID:

Go to Google Calendar
Click the settings gear icon
Click on your calendar in the left sidebar
Scroll down to "Integrate calendar"
Copy the Calendar ID
The calendar section includes:

Responsive embed that works on mobile devices
Clean, consistent styling matching the rest of the site
"Add to Your Calendar" button for easy subscription
Set to Swedish timezone (Europe/Stockholm)
Simplified interface with unnecessary controls removed
Would you like any adjustments to the calendar's appearance or functionality?
